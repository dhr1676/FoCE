1.Compile: make all

2.Run: ./main_q1 or make run

3.Clean: make clean

Note:
In the homework question 1, we are asked to test 3 conditions, however, we can't test these 3 conditions at one time. Because if a non-existing key is passed, the program will be aborted at once. So we have to run at least 2 times to check all these 3 conditions.

I have written the comment in the code for 3 conditions. You can check that by modifying the condition and running 2 times.
